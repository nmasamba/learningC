A queue is a FIFO data structure in which the element
that is inserted first is the first one to be taken out.
∑ The elementsin a queue are added at one end called the
rear and removed from the other end called the front.
∑	 In the computer ’s memory, queues can be
implemented using both arrays and linked lists.
∑ The storage requirement of linked representation of
queue with n elements is O(n) and the typical time
requirement for operations is O(1).
∑	 In a circular queue, the first index comes after the
last index.
∑ Multiple queues meansto have more than one queue
in the same array of sufficient size.
∑ A deque is a list in which elements can be inserted
or deleted at either end. It is also known as a headtail
linked list because elements can be added to
or removed from the front (head) or back (tail).
However, no element can be added or deleted from
the middle. In the computer’s memory, a deque
is implemented using either a circular array or a
circular doubly linked list.
∑ In an input restricted deque, insertions can be
done only at one end, while deletions can be done
from both the ends. In an output restricted deque,
deletions can be done only at one end, while
insertions can be done at both the ends.
∑ A priority queue is a data structure in which each
element is assigned a priority. The priority of the
element will be used to determine the orderin which
the elements will be processed.
∑ When a priority queue isimplemented using a linked
list,then every node ofthe listwill have threeparts:(a)
the information or data part,(b)the priority number of
the element, and (c) the address of the next element.
