An M-way search tree has M – 1 values per node and
M sub-trees. In such a tree, M is called the degree of
the tree. M-way search tree consists of pointers to M
sub-trees and contains M – 1 keys, where M > 2.
∑ A B tree of order m can have a maximum of m–1
keys and m pointers to its sub-trees. A B tree may
contain a large number of key values and pointers
to its sub-trees.
∑ A B+ tree is a variant of B tree which stores sorted
data in a way that allows for efficient insertion,
retrieval, and removal of records, each of which
is identified by a key. B+ tree record data at the
leaf level of the tree; only keys are stored in interior
nodes.
∑ A trie is an ordered tree data structure which stores
keys that are usually strings. It is basically a k-ary
position tree.
∑ In contrast to binary search trees, nodes in a trie
do not store the keys associated with them. Rather,
a node’s position in the tree represents the key
associated with that node.
∑ In a 2-3 tree, each interior node has either two or
three children. This means that a 2-3 tree is not a
binary tree.
