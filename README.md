Algorithms and data structures are explored in the C language. The repository contains code which emphasises computational thinking and understanding of programming architecture (e.g. memory issues and pointers). Additional explanatory comments are included in every program. Based on the book Data Structures in C, 2nd Ed by Reema Thareja.
