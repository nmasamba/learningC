∑ A stack is a linear data structure in which elements
are added and removed only from one end, which
is called the top. Hence, a stack is called a LIFO
(Last-In, First-Out) data structure as the element
that is inserted last is the first one to be taken out.
∑ In the computer’s memory, stacks can be implemented
using either linked lists or single arrays.
∑ The storage requirement of linked representation of
stack with n elements is O(n) and the typical time
requirement for operations is O(1).
∑ Infix, prefix, and postfix notations are three different
but equivalent notations of writing algebraic expressions.
∑ In postfix notation, operators are placed after the
operands, whereas in prefix notation, operators are
placed before the operands.
∑ Postfix notations are evaluated using stacks. Every
character of the postfix expression is scanned from
left to right. If the character is an operand, it is
pushed onto the stack. Else, if it is an operator, then
the top two values are popped from the stack and
the operator is applied on these values. The result
is then pushed onto the stack.
∑ Multiple stacks means to have more than one stack
in the same array of sufficient size.
∑ A recursive function is defined as a function that calls
itself to solve a smaller version of its task until a final
call is made which does not require a call to itself.
They are implmented using system stack.
