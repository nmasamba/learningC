∑ A binary heap is defined as a complete binary tree in
which every node satisfies the heap property. There
are two types of binary heaps: max heap and min
heap.
∑ In a min heap, elements at every node will either be
less than or equal to the element at its left and right
child. Similarly, in a max heap, elements at every
node will either be greater than or equal to element
at its left and right child.
∑ A binomial tree of order i has a root node whose
children are the root nodes of binomial trees of order
i–1, i–2, ..., 2, 1, 0.
∑ A binomial tree Bi
 of height i has 2i nodes.
∑ A binomial heap H is a collection of binomial trees
that satisfy the following properties:
o Every binomial tree in H satisfies the minimum
heap property.
o There can be one or zero binomial trees for each
order including zero order.
∑ A Fibonacci heap is a collection of trees. Fibonacci
heaps differ from binomial heaps, as they have
a more relaxed structure, allowing improved
asymptotic time bounds.
