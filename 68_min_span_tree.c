This C program uses Prim's (greedy) algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of the graph and its 
associated cost.
A minimum spanning tree (MST) is defined as a spanning tree with weight less than or equal
to the weight of every other spanning tree. In other words, a minimum spanning tree is a spanning
tree that has weights associated with its edges, and the total weight of the tree (the sum of the
weights of its edges) is at a minimum.

Example I/O
Enter the number of nodes in the Graph : 3

 Enter the adjacency matrix of the Graph: 1 0 1
1 1 1
0 1 0

 Enter the Source : 2

 The Edges of the Mininum Spanning Tree are 2 1 2 3 

 The Total cost of the Minimum Spanning Tree is : 4
